## Sample UI with Highcharts Charts

This project showcases a basic UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that features charts powered by Highcharts. It offers four different views displaying charts for various timeframes:

- 12 months
- 6 months
- 7 days
- 24 hours

**Key Components:**

- HTML: Defines the page structure and loads resources.
- CSS: Styles the UI elements.
- JavaScript (charts.js): Handles interactive chart generation and configuration based on the selected timeframe.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Highcharts (if needed):
3. Run a live server 
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

**Explore the Timeframes:**

Click on the buttons to switch between different chart views corresponding to the desired timeframe. The charts will automatically adjust their data and display accordingly.

**Customization:**

To modify the charts (data, appearance, behavior), edit the JavaScript code in `demo.js`. Refer to Highcharts documentation for advanced options: [https://www.highcharts.com/](https://www.highcharts.com/)

**Please note:** This is a basic example for learning purposes.
